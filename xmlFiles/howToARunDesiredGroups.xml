<suite name="Executing a group" verbose="10">

    <test name="Executing desired group">

        <!-- to execute desired groups
        first we need to mark the methods by giving names to them after @Test notations
        it should be like this : @Test ( groups = {"groupName1","groupName2"}
        if there is only one group name we do not need to use curly brackets

        to run desired methods
        we need to set two things
        1) Where are the groups ? ( we need to set package names, if we want to check all the packages we can write <package name="tests.*"></package>
        2) what are the groups' names.

        to enter these information
        we need to create two hierarchy

        first one will be about groups' names
        second one will be about packages

        we can give more than one name to a group

        /**
        if we want to see more detail about the test we are executing
        we can use verbose

        after the suite's name, we should press space then write verbose and enter a number from 1 to 10
        10 means max detail
        1 means min detail
